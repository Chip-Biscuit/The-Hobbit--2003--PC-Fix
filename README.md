# The-Hobbit-(2003)-PC-Fix

The Hobbit (2003) PC Fix dll wrapper

# Requirements before using fix
For the fixes to work properly you must have patched the game up to 1.3 release. If you have not done so already then you can download the patch from here https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1074-the-hobbit-patches/ 

# Instructions
Go to release, download the zip file and extract it, then put the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini into your game folder next to the Meridian.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d8.ini file.

# Resolution
It is advised that the resolution is changed within the pause menu options. This is due to a bug that can occur on the main menu which prevents the user from being able to change their resolution properly.

# FOV
FOV is off by default in the ini which is set to (0). The ini has 3 options to choose from in this fix, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1),(2) or (3).
