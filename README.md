# The-Hobbit-(2003)-PC-Fix
This is The Hobbit PC FPS and FOV fix dll wrapper

simply go to release, download the zip extract it and then put the d3d8.dll and d3d8.ini into your game folder next to the game exe and your good to go 

FOV mod is off by default (0) in the ini you have 3 options to choose from in this fix, slightly zoomed out, a bit more zoomed out and mega zoomed out (1),(2) or (3) 

you can edit settings in d3d8.ini 

Resolution can be changed in Game Video options.   

FPS can be toggled in the game, a message box will pop up before the game opens to give you instructions on what to do. click OK on the first then click any button on your keyboard or mouse it will then confirm your choice and launch the 
game
This will mean that you can use the key you select to toggle between 30 and 60 FPS in game at any time.

TheHobbitfix-nomessagebox.zip has no message box when you launch the game to choose a key for the fps toggle, this means that the fps toggle will always be on keyboard key "O" in this specific release

if the fps doesnt toggle on the first press press your hotkey again and itll work after.
